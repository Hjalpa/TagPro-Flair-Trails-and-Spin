# TagPro-Flair-Trails-and-Spinner
Have sick trails for all your flairs just like the arc reactor. (Without having to level up) But wait there's more. You can also have your flairs spin like the level 4 donor flair absolutely free.

Make sure to go into the script and update the following settings to your liking.
- spinFlair: set this to true to enable spin on your flair
- useTrail: set this to true to enable the trail on your flair
- displayName: set this to your Display Name (not your reserved name, using the reserved name would be better but it's a lot more work to implement that)
